However, vegan athletes often face unique nutritional challenges related to dietary deficiencies of critical nutrients such as proteins, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, among others. This narrative review aims to explore the efficacy and benefits of vegan-friendly supplements specifically tailored to athletic performance, focusing on essential micronutrients, ergogenic aids, and nutrient bioavailability.\\nNineteen key supplements are discussed, including protein powders, creatine, beta-alanine, caffeine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, calcium, iron, iodine, vitamin K2, selenium, probiotics, nitrates, electrolytes (including sodium and potassium), taurine, vitamin A, and magnesium. Evidence suggests that the integration of these supplements into personalized nutrition plans can bridge dietary gaps while addressing specific performance needs, potentially leveling the competitive field for vegan athletes. Recent studies also highlight research gaps in sex-specific needs, synergistic effects, and strategies to enhance the bioavailability of nutrients from whole foods. Vegan diets, while conferring various benefits, require careful consideration of nutrient intake for athletes seeking optimal performance. Personalized biochemical assessments should be considered when possible for tailoring specific nutritional guidelines for each case. This narrative review provides practical guidelines for clinicians, nutritionists, trainers, sports scientists, and athletes to design personalized supplementation strategies that address common nutritional shortfalls, enhance performance, and serve as a foundation for future research in vegan sports nutrition.', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2025, 3, 12)}, {'title': 'Study on the Effect of Bifidobacterium adolescentis CCFM1066 on Exercise Performance, Gut Microbiota, and Its Metabolites in Mice.', 'authors': ['Wang, Hongchao', 'Ma, Huizi', 'Yan, Huimin', 'Pei, Zhangming', 'Zhao, Jianxin', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Zhang, Zhijian', 'Lu, Wenwei'], 'abstract': 'Prolonged high-intensity exercise consumes significant energy, leading to fatigue and decreased performance. This study explores the effects of Bifidobacterium adolescentis CCFM1066 on exercise performance, gut microbiota, and its metabolites in mice.

This case discusses a patient with HPP along with electrocardiogram (ECG) findings of Brugada phenocopies (BrP) in the setting of hypokalemia. A review of the literature showed that it is the seventh documented example of BrP induced by hypokalemia alongside HPP.\\nA 43-year-old man presented to the emergency department with lower limb weakness. He attributed his symptoms to a substantial meal consumed after breaking his Ramadan fast, recalling a similar episode following heavy meals in the past. The patient was alert and oriented but demonstrated reduced strength in both upper and lower limbs. ECG revealed a Brugada type 1 pattern. Laboratory analysis revealed hypokalemia (2.5 mmol/l), elevated creatine kinase (326 U/l), and normal thyroid function. Following potassium supplementation, his symptoms resolved, and his ECG normalized.\\nHPP occurs in the context of increased carbohydrate intake, potentially leading to rapid insulin release and activation of Na-K ATPase, enhancing cellular potassium absorption and lowering serum potassium levels. Symptoms range from weakness and fatigue to severe neuromuscular weakness and cardiac arrhythmias. Investigating hypokalemia requires excluding hypomagnesemia, thyroid function tests, and metabolic acidosis/alkalosis before considering HPP. Management involves gradual oral potassium repletion to avoid the risk of hyperkalemia associated with intravenous administration.\\nClinicians should consider including HPP in differential diagnoses of patients presenting with weakness. In this case, electrophysiological evaluation suggested Brugada pattern induced by hypokalemia, which resolved with potassium supplementation.\\nThis case highlights the rarity and diagnostic challenges of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, offering critical insights into recognizing and managing such conditions in clinical practice.The case also demonstrates the importance of identifying reversible electrocardiogram changes like Brugada patterns, aiding in differentiation from persistent arrhythmias and avoiding unnecessary interventions.', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2025, 3, 7)}, {'title': 'D-BHB supplementation before moderate-intensity exercise suppresses lipolysis and selectively blunts exercise-induced long-chain acylcarnitine increase in pilot study of patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders.', 'authors': ['Gregor, Ashley N', 'Delerive, Philippe', 'Cuenoud, Bernard', 'Monnard, Irina', 'Redeuil, Karine', 'Harding, Cary O', 'Gillingham, Melanie B'], 'abstract': 'Patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD) have impaired endogenous ketone production due to defects in the beta-oxidation pathway.

Plasma D-BHB levels achieved mild ketosis and suppressed lipolysis and the associated rise in LC-AC, but fell short of stimulating the energetic effects that might have resulted in altered exercise parameters such as RER, or HR.

However, their slow inference speed limits their practical utility in such applications. To address this challenge, we propose speculative decoding with a simple chemically specific drafting strategy and apply it to the Molecular Transformer, an encoder-decoder transformer for conditional SMILES generation. Our approach achieves over 3X faster inference in reaction product prediction and single-step retrosynthesis with no loss in accuracy, increasing the potential of the transformer as the backbone of synthesis planning systems. To accelerate the simultaneous generation of multiple precursor SMILES for a given query SMILES in single-step retrosynthesis, we introduce Speculative Beam Search, a novel algorithm tackling the challenge of beam search acceleration with speculative decoding.

Breast cancer is a result of abnormal cells in the breast tissue growing out of control. Histopathology, which refers to the detection and learning of tissue diseases, has appeared as a solution for breast cancer treatment as it plays a vital role in its diagnosis and classification. Thus, considerable research on histopathology in medical and computer science has been conducted to develop an effective method for breast cancer treatment. In this study, a vision Transformer (ViT) was employed to classify tumors into two classes, benign and malignant, in the Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis). To enhance the model performance, we introduced the novel multi-head locality large kernel self-attention during fine-tuning, achieving an accuracy of 95.94% at 100× magnification, thereby improving the accuracy by 3.34% compared to a standard ViT (which uses multi-head self-attention). In addition, the application of principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction led to an accuracy improvement of 3.34%, highlighting its role in mitigating overfitting and reducing the computational complexity. In the final phase, SHapley Additive exPlanations, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping were used for the interpretability and explainability of machine-learning models, aiding in understanding the feature importance and local explanations, and visualizing the model attention. In another experiment, ensemble learning with VGGIN further boosted the performance to 97.13% accuracy.

Early detection and intervention are crucial for slowing PD progression. Understanding PD's diverse pathways and mechanisms is key to advancing knowledge. Recent advances in noninvasive imaging and multi-omics technologies have provided valuable insights into PD's underlying causes and biological processes. However, integrating these diverse data sources remains challenging, especially when deriving meaningful low-level features that can serve as diagnostic indicators. This study developed and validated a novel integrative, multimodal predictive model for detecting PD based on features derived from multimodal data, including hematological information, proteomics, RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and dopamine transporter scan imaging, sourced from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Several model architectures were investigated and evaluated, including support vector machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, fully connected neural networks with concatenation and joint modeling (FCNN_C and FCNN_JM), and a multimodal encoder-based model with multi-head cross-attention (MMT_CA). The MMT_CA model demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving a balanced classification accuracy of 97.7%, thus highlighting its ability to capture and leverage cross-modality inter-dependencies to aid predictive analytics. Furthermore, feature importance analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations not only identified crucial diagnostic biomarkers to inform the predictive models in this study but also holds potential for future research aimed at integrated functional analyses of PD from a multi-omics perspective, ultimately revealing targets required for precision medicine approaches to aid treatment of PD aimed at slowing down its progression.\", 'publication_date': datetime.date(2025, 3, 10)}, {'title': 'Non-invasive enhanced hypertension detection through ballistocardiograph signals with Mamba model.', 'authors': ['Alhudhaif, Adi', 'Polat, Kemal'], 'abstract': \"This study explores using ballistocardiography (BCG), a non-invasive cardiovascular monitoring technique, combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning models for hypertension detection. The motivation behind this research is to develop a non-invasive and efficient approach for long-term hypertension monitoring, facilitating home-based health assessments. A dataset of 128 BCG recordings has been used, capturing body micro-vibrations from cardiac activity. Various classification models, including Mamba Classifier, Transformer, Stacking, Voting, and XGBoost, were applied to differentiate hypertensive individuals from normotensive ones. In this study, integrating BCG signals with deep learning and machine learning models for hypertension detection is distinguished from previous literature by employing the Mamba deep learning architecture and Transformer-based models. Unlike conventional methods in literature, this study enables more effective analysis of time-series data with the Mamba architecture, capturing long-term signal dependencies and achieving higher accuracy rates. In particular, the combined use of Mamba architecture and the Transformer model's signal processing capabilities represents a novel approach not previously seen in the literature. While existing studies on BCG signals typically rely on traditional machine learning algorithms, this study aims to achieve higher success rates in hypertension detection by integrating signal processing and deep learning stages. The Mamba Classifier outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 95.14% and an AUC of 0.9922 in the 25% hold-out validation. Transformer and Stacking models also demonstrated strong performance, while the Voting and XGBoost models showed comparatively lower results. When combined with artificial intelligence techniques, the findings indicate the potential of BCG signals in providing non-invasive, long-term hypertension detection. The results suggest that the Mamba Classifier is the most effective model for this dataset. This research underscores the potential of BCG technology for continuous home-based health monitoring, providing a feasible alternative to traditional methods.
