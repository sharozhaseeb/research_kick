Potential for use in high risk subgroups such as those with higher bleeding risk.\\nTABLE:\\nTables and Figures\\nTable 1: Baseline characteristics of patients undergoing catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) versus anticoagulation only for sub-massive pulmonary embolism in years 2016-2022. \\nCharacteristic\\tCatheter-Directed Thrombolysis (n=3,559)\\tAnticoagulation only (n=22,910)\\tp-value\\nAge in years (mean± SD)\\t61.12 ± 14.69\\n\\n65.64 ± 15.51\\n\\t<0.001* \\n\\nSex\\t\\t\\t0.000\\nMale (%)\\t1,830 (51.43)\\t10,911 (47.63)\\t\\nFemale (%)\\t1,728 (48.57)\\t11,995 (52.37)\\t\\nRace\\t\\t\\t0.003\\nWhite (%)\\t2,706 (78.62)\\t17,063 (76.73)\\t\\nBlack (%)\\t610 (17.72)\\t4,081 (18.35)\\t\\nHispanic (%)\\t126 (3.66)\\t1,093 (4.92)\\t\\nIncome Quartile\\t\\t\\t0.095\\n0-25th (%)\\t948 (26.89)\\t5,948 (26.39)\\t\\n26-50th (%)\\t999 (28.34)\\t6,042 (26.80)\\t\\n51-75th (%)\\t890 (25.25)\\t5,833 (25.88)\\t\\n76-100th (%)\\t688 (19.52)\\t4,719 (20.93)\\t\\nPrimary Payer\\t\\t\\t0.000\\nMedicare (%)\\t1,622 (45.57)\\t12,954 (56.54)\\t\\nMedicaid (%)\\t312 (8.77)\\t2,531 (11.05)\\t\\nPrivate Insurance (%)\\t1,346 (37.82)\\t6,066 (26.48)\\t\\nOther (%)\\t276 (7.75)\\t1,328 (5.80)\\t\\nHospital Bed Size\\t\\t\\t0.000\\nSmall (%)\\t629 (17.67)\\t4,734 (20.66)\\t\\nMedium (%)\\t1,034 (29.05)\\t6,543 (28.56)\\t\\nLarge (%)\\t1,896 (53.27)\\t11,633 (50.78)\\t\\nHospital Region\\t\\t\\t0.000\\nNortheast region (%)\\t450 (12.64)\\t4,245 (18.53)\\t\\nMidwest region (%)\\t1,246 (35.01)\\t6,225 (27.17)\\t\\nSouth region (%)\\t1,443 (40.55)\\t8,131 (35.49)\\t\\nWest region (%)\\t420 (11.80)\\t4,309 (18.81)\\t\\nHospital Location/Teaching Status\\t\\t\\t0.000\\nRural (%)\\t160 (4.50)\\t1,754 (7.66)\\t\\nUrban Non-Teaching (%)\\t671 (18.85)\\t4,146 (18.10)\\t\\nUrban Teaching (%)\\t2,728 (76.65)\\t17,010 (74.25)\\t\\nCo-morbidities\\t\\t\\t\\nCharlson Comorbidity Index Score\\t3.27±0.04\\t4.531±0.019\\t<0.001                          \\nChronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (%)\\t179 (5.03% )\\t1,926 (8.41%)\\t<0.001*\\nCancer (%)\\t177 (4.97%)\\t2,402 (10.48%)\\t<0.001*\\nMyocardial Infarction (MI) (%)\\t437 (12.28%)\\t3,152 (13.76%)\\t0.017*\\nCongestive Heart Failure (CHF) (%)\\t658 (18.49%)\\t7,663 (33.45%)\\t<0.001*\\nLiver Disease(%)\\t147 (4.13%)\\t1,287 (5.62%)\\t<0.001*\\nLiver Failure(%)\\t3 (0.08%)\\t131 (0.57%)\\t<0.001*\\nRheumatic Disease (%)\\t94 (2.64%)\\t705 (3.08%)\\t0.171\\nPeripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) (%)\\t128 (3.60%)\\t1,168 (5.10%)\\t<0.001*\\nMetastatic Cancer(%)\\t97 (2.73%)\\t1,548 (6.76%)\\t<0.001*\\nChronic Pulmonary Disease(%)\\t730 (20.51%)\\t6,727 (29.36%)\\t<0.001*\\nAIDS/HIV(%)\\t4 (0.11%)\\t58 (0.25%)\\t0.134\\nDiabetes without Complications(%)\\t399 (11.21%)\\t2,535 (11.07%)\\t0.796\\nDementia(%)\\t106 (2.98%)\\t1,835 (8.01%)\\t<0.001*\\nParalysis(%)\\t26 (0.73%)\\t375 (1.64%)\\t<0.001*\\nPeptic Ulcer Disease(%)\\t23 (0.65%)\\t247 (1.08%)\\t0.015*\\nCerebrovascular Disease (Stroke, TIA) (%)\\t96 (2.70%)\\t1,199 (5.23%)\\t<0  .001*\\nCDT, catheter-directed thrombolysis; CKD, chronic kidney disease; MI, Myocardial Infarction; CHF; congestive heart failure; PVD, peripheral vascular disease; TIA, transient ischemic attack; SD, standard deviation.\\n\\u2003\\nTable 2: Outcomes of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) vs. Anticoagulation only for sub-\\nmassive pulmonary embolism in years 2016-2022. \\nOutcome  \\tUnadjusted   Odds Ratio\\tUnadjusted 95% CI \\tAdjusted\\nOdds Ratio \\tAdjusted 95% CI \\tp-value\\nEfficacy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nIn -hospital mortality \\t0.28\\t(0.22 – 0.35)\\t0.33\\t(0.26 – 0.43)\\t<0.001\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nHarms\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAny bleedinga\\t0.84\\t(0.74-0.95)\\t0.91\\t(0.80-1.04)\\t0.177\\nIntracranial Hemorrhage (ICH)\\t0.69\\t(0.45-1.06)\\t0.79\\t(0.50-1.27)\\t0.335\\nNon-ICH bleedingb\\t0.86\\t(0.75-0.98)\\t0.92\\t(0.80-1.06)\\t0.261\\nCosts (in USD\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tUnadjusted costs\\tUnadjusted costs 95% CI\\tAdjusted Costs \\tAdjusted costs 95% CI\\tp-value\\n\\t$5,623\\t(4,944 – 6,303)\\t$10,666\\t($10,093 – 11,240)\\t<0.001\\nLength of stay (days)\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tUnadjusted LOS\\tUnadjusted LOS 95% CI\\tAdjusted LOS\\tAdjusted LOS 95% CI\\tp-value\\n\\t-1.61\\t(-1.80 – -1.43)\\t-1.21\\t(-1.41 – -1.00)\\t<0.001\\n\\n\\nICH, intracranial hemorrhage. \\na= Any bleeding includes intracranial bleeding, thoracic bleed, gastrointestinal bleed, hemoperitoneum, hemopericardium, hemarthrosis, gynecological bleed, hematuria. \\nb= non-ICH bleeding is all bleeding except ICH.\\nAdjusted for age, sex, race, diabetes, liver disease, liver failure, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction, dementia, paralysis, AIDS/HIV, rheumatic disease, peptic ulcer disease, metastatic cancer, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, hospital size (number of beds), hospital region, income.\\n\\n'"
