"text": "OBJECTIVE: Identify distinct clinical phenotypes in PsA and their associations with treatment outcomes using the PsA Research Consortium (PARC) cohort

KEY FINDINGS:

1.        3 data driven clusters identified in this real-world study. Among different disease characteristics, the degree of psoriasis and PsA seem to be the most important. This also resonates with clinical practice.

2.        Clusters remained stable across different visits, although some patients moved from one cluster to the next over the visits.

3.        The clusters had significantly different treatment responses to the first therapy and first TNFi started in the cohort. Could be related to the following reasons:

- Psoriasis responds better to therapy compared to PsA (cluster 3)
- Ceiling effect with cluster 1 patients not having much room to improve
- Current disease activity/functional status measures are not adequately capturing disease status

4.        Significant proportion of patients in cluster 1 (low disease activity) were also started on therapy, suggesting the current measures likely do not capture disease activity well for this subgroup. Disease activity measures do not correlate well with clinical decision making for this subgroup.

CORE MESSAGE: 3 PsA phenotypes driven by degree of psoriasis and PsA are associated with significantly different treatment response (defined by MCII).

KEY IMPLICATIONS: The clinically relevant PsA phenotypes identified in this study demonstrated differences in therapy response. The phenotypes identified could inform potential interventions that target patients less likely to respond to therapy. Furthermore, characteristics of the phenotypes will help ascertain which baseline PsA characteristics will be important to capture in future pragmatic trials from the EHR. Furthermore, better outcome measures are required to capture disease activity/impact and treatment response in the PsA phenotype with low disease activity (cluster 1), which constituted the majority of PsA patients in our cohort. Unfortunately, these patients do not qualify for RCTs, where the inclusion criteria is usually >4 tender and swollen joints.

"text": "Our study demonstrates the heterogeneity of PsA and highlights the potential value of identifying subgroups based on distinct clinical characteristics to inform treatment decisions and advance personalized care. Our objective was to address this goal by utilizing semi-supervised clustering methods to identify potential subgroups in this real-world population. We identified three distinct clusters based on phenotypic characteristics, primarily driven by the relative severity of PsA and psoriasis. Notably, these clusters exhibited remarkable stability across follow-up visits, although transitions between clusters were observed in some patients over time. Importantly, these clusters demonstrated significant improvements in disease activity (cDAPSA) and disease impact (PsAID) scores for the initial therapy, but not for the first TNFi initiated within the cohort. The clusters identified are thus somewhat intuitive and align with clinical practice, where treatment decisions are most often based on the severity of PsA and psoriasis.

Other studies have also investigated PsA clusters based on phenotype, albeit using differing variables. For instance, a single center study from Hungary identified seven PsA clusters based on joint distribution and psoriasis type.[1] Additionally, secondary analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined clusters defined by disease phenotypes. Unlike our study, these post-hoc analyses of RCTs found additional clusters for dactylitis, enthesitis, or axial involvement.[2–4] However, differences in clusters identified in RCTs are likely related to differences in the population being studied and variables included in the clustering process. Specifically, in our real-world cohort, the prevalence and severity dactylitis and enthesitis were very low compared to the patients included in the RCTs. We also did not include specific joint involvement (e.g., hands, feet) as clustering variables. While axial disease was included, the lower prevalence of patients with axial involvement in our study may have led to this not being a separate cluster. Similarly, methodological differences in clustering could have also accounted for the differences in clusters obtained. Unlike these prior studies, we performed Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) to account for collinearity among the clinical variables followed by hierarchical clustering. We utilized this method to “let the data tell us” what was important or not important so as not to first judge the most important variables a priori. In clinical practice, we use a certain clinical framework to categorize PsA patients into different subgroups in relation to their long-term prognosis. However, often the complexity of PsA patients and the number of variables to consider can hinder categorizing patients. In the study, we considered all important clinical variables, which we included into the factor analysis and clustering. The fact that we still found PsA and PsO severity as the most important factors acknowledges how we assess and manage the disease in clinical practice.

While prior studies have not examined PsA clusters longitudinally, the stability of clusters over time in our cohort aligns with the University of Toronto PsA cohort, where most patients with oligoarticular disease maintained their disease pattern over time.[5] However, our study also observed some patients transitioning between clusters, especially for Cluster 3 with severe psoriasis and PsA, reflecting changes in disease severity, clinical manifestations, and response to therapy. This stability could be leveraged in clinical practice by developing long-term management plans tailored to these stable phenotype profiles. This finding together with the difference in treatment responses across the clusters underscore the importance of considering patient phenotypes in treatment decisions. Better treatment response observed in Clusters 2 and 3 with high disease activity and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) observed in our cohort align with prior studies which showed that high baseline disease activity, and CRP were associated with improved treatment response or persistence of TNFi in PsA.[6,7]  Notably, these clusters showed better treatment response despite having a high BMI, which has been shown to be associated with worse treatment outcomes.[8] It is possible that the severity of psoriasis and PsA may play a more crucial role in determining treatment effectiveness than BMI alone. However, the difference in treatment response might also reflect limitations in our current PsA outcome measures, in particular, a floor effect for patients in cluster 1.

Interestingly, our findings indicate that a significant number of patients in Clusters 1 and 2, who were already at a patient-acceptable symptom state (PsAID≤4), opted to initiate new therapies. This decision could reflect a misalignment between our current clinical measures and the patients' personal experience of their disease, suggesting that current measures might not fully capture the patient's quality of life or functional limitations. Consequently, the results of traditional RCTs, which often rely on these very measures, may not be generalizable to the broader PsA patient population seen in clinical practice, where many exhibit lower disease activity at baseline.

The lower disease activity seen in clinical practice also has relevance for interpretation of the findings of this study. The absolute scores for cDAPSA and PsAID did not differ at follow up among the clusters and the proportion of patients achieving cDAPSA remission and PsAID patient acceptable symptom state was also similar at follow up. However, patients in cluster 3 started at a higher level of disease activity and had a greater improvement in the cDAPSA and PsAID scores. This demonstrates the floor effects of current measures, the challenges in measuring and interpreting disease improvement and the need for more sensitive and nuanced tools to capture the full spectrum of disease activity, particularly for those in the lower disease activity cluster. Additionally, it may prompt more detailed evaluations to understand the factors driving treatment changes despite seemingly controlled disease states in patients in the lower disease activity states.

The robustness of our identified clusters is demonstrated across different follow-ups and among patients initiating therapy, with most patients staying within their baseline cluster throughout the follow-up period. This consistency enhances the clinical utility of our findings. However, several limitations should be considered when interpreting our results. First, our study included patients at various stages of their disease, not just those with new diagnoses. This means the initial therapy post-enrollment may not represent their first-ever treatment. Next, axial involvement was determined by the ASAS axial spondyloarthritis criteria, with diagnostic imaging performed at the discretion of the treating physician.[9] This could have led to missed cases of asymptomatic or mild axial disease due to selective imaging practices. We also did not incorporate the pattern of peripheral joint involvement in our clustering analysis. Our preliminary modeling revealed that including specific joint counts (e.g., MCP, PIP) resulted in the clustering driven primarily by the total number of affected joints, rather than providing distinct patterns of disease. To focus on clinically meaningful distinctions and reduce redundancy in constructs, we opted to include only the total swollen and tender joint counts (Supplemental Figures 4 & 5). Additionally, we did not account for comorbidities such as fibromyalgia or depression, which are known to influence treatment outcomes. The lack of a specific cluster for mild PsA with severe psoriasis can potentially be due to referral biases (i.e., these patients may predominantly receive care from dermatologists).

The COVID-19 pandemic caused an interruption in our study in 2020, leading to incomplete follow-up for patients enrolled in 2019 and early 2020. There is also the possibility that the greater improvement observed in cluster 3 represents regression to the mean, a limitation common to studies examining treatment effects. Lastly, the study's generalizability may be limited by a selection bias towards patients from academic centers with PsA expertise, potentially skewing the cohort towards more severe or treatment-resistant cases.

In conclusion, psoriatic arthritis is a highly heterogeneous disease, and our use of machine learning methods helped simplify patient categorization by focusing on the severity of both skin and joint involvement. This categorization was not only relevant for understanding disease subgroups but also for predicting treatment response. Clinically, this highlights the need for a holistic approach to PsA management. Patients with PsA are often followed by rheumatologists who are trained to consider primarily the musculoskeletal disease, but these results emphasize the importance of skin severity, which should be equally considered in therapy selection. In this specific study, we did not consider differential treatment response by therapy class. In a larger dataset with more patients utilizing non-TNFi biologic therapies, a similar study could be repeated to understand the impact of therapy selection on outcomes in each cluster. This would help inform personalized medicine approaches. At the same time, our results highlight the need for better outcome measures that allow us to capture important aspects of disease and validly measure disease activity. Furthermore, there is a pressing need for improved therapies targeting MSK manifestations and a deeper understanding of expected therapeutic response.

"text": "Our population-based study, examining the time to PsA diagnosis and factors associated with diagnostic delay, highlights the persistent issue of diagnostic delays in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and the importance of understanding demographic and clinical factors contributing to these delays. Despite advancements in diagnostic tools and clinical awareness, our findings reveal that over half of PsA patients experienced significant delays in diagnosis. Younger age at PsA symptom onset, obesity, and enthesitis were associated with a delay in diagnosis of longer than 2 years. The importance of diagnosing PsA early has been outlined in several studies, and delay in diagnosis has been shown to be associated with poor outcomes in PsA. Studies from UK and Canada show that diagnostic delay of greater than 1 year and 2 years respectively were associated with worse functional outcomes (1,2). Observational studies have reported improved outcomes in PsA patients receiving early treatment; these improved outcomes may be long lasting (1–4). While PsA can sometimes be mild, requiring minimal pharmacological therapy, high risk patients may benefit from earlier diagnosis. Therefore, additional efforts are needed to shorten the time from symptom onset to diagnosis.

Several patient and system related factors may contribute to delay of diagnosis: 1) patient factors; 2) practitioner delay in recognition or referral; and 3) system delays (i.e., time to rheumatology visit) (5,6). Our study found that patients with younger age at PsA symptom onset, higher BMI, or enthesitis before diagnosis were more likely to have a diagnostic delay of two or more years. It is possible that patients with younger age may dismiss their symptoms. Similarly, patients may not report joint pain symptoms or may not be aware of joint inflammation (7). Symptoms such as enthesitis may be attributed to overuse and trauma. Obese patients may attribute joint symptoms to more commonly associated diseases such as osteoarthritis or gout. Longer time to diagnosis (5.7 vs. 2.8 years) was also noted in obese patients compared to patients with normal BMI in the University of Toronto PsA cohort (8).

Similarly, delay could be related to provider misattribution of PsA signs or symptoms to more common conditions, such as trauma, overuse, degenerative disease, fibromyalgia, or gout. In a US patient survey, less recognized symptoms of PsA, such as enthesitis and back pain, were also associated with diagnostic delay (9). Inflammatory back pain symptoms were not different between patients with and without diagnostic delay in our study. An important and novel finding of our study is the association of obesity with diagnostic delay. BMI is accurately captured in the REP database with height and weight captured at each visit. Obesity could make the joint examination difficult; other concurrent joint pathologies, such as degenerative disease and gout, are also more common in obesity. In the absence of apparent psoriasis or other extra-articular manifestations of SpA, manifestations of enthesitis and joint symptoms in obese patients may not be diagnosed until late after the development of objective clinical or radiologic findings. In our study, patients with sebo-psoriasis were less likely to have a diagnostic delay. While it is debatable whether this is a true psoriasis variant, early diagnosis of sebo-psoriasis by a dermatologist could aid rheumatologists in diagnosing a patient with PsA in the right setting.

Previous studies have examined time to PsA diagnosis, and the results have been variable. In a study from Denmark, the average time from initial symptoms to diagnosis was 3.42 years (SD = 4.75) (10). Another study from an older referral cohort (University of Toronto) using CASPAR criteria reported that 60% of patients had >2 years of symptoms (median 11 years in this group) before PsA diagnosis (2). The reported times to diagnosis in other studies are slightly better. A study from the UK using CASPAR criteria showed that only one-third of patients had a symptom duration of ≥1 year before diagnosis (1). Similarly, another study from a rheumatology clinic in Dublin reported the median time from symptom onset to first rheumatologic assessment was 1 year (IQR 0.5–2) (4). The outcome in this study was first rheumatologic assessment rather than an established diagnosis of PsA, which could explain the lower median delay in the study compared to ours. Finally, in a cross-sectional web-based survey from the US, one-third of PsA patients sought medical attention after 1 year of symptom onset; up to one-third of the patients had ≥5 years between seeking medical attention and receiving a diagnosis (9). However, the results of this survey study should be interpreted in the context of the limitations of surveys, including potential recall, participation, or ascertainment bias with regard to PsA diagnosis (e.g., self-reported diagnosis).

Secular trends in diagnostic delay have not been robustly studied. The study from Denmark showed improvement in time to diagnosis of PsA from 2000 to 2011 (42 months in 2000-02 to 7 months in 2009-11) (10). This study was conducted within the DANBIO registry where patient eligibility was restricted to patients on biologic therapy (i.e., only patients with severe PsA) and included before 2005. Similarly, recall bias was a potential concern in this study, especially in patients with longer symptom duration because symptom onset was collected at study registration. In our study, we did not find a change in time to diagnosis between 2000 and 2017.

Improvement in identification and subsequent referral of patients with inflammatory arthritis will require a concerted effort. The Psoriatic Arthritis Forum consensus had recommended identification of cases in the community, public awareness programs, patient education, self-administered surveys, referral guidelines for community practitioners, and integrated multidisciplinary clinics with dermatologists and rheumatologists (11). Use of some of these approaches have been shown to improve diagnostic delays (12). Additionally, some validated screening tools in psoriasis could help capture PsA features such as enthesitis and back pain (13). Advanced imaging techniques, such as ultrasound in clinical practice, could improve detection of enthesitis and joint inflammation in the obese. Moreover, our results emphasize the complicated relationship between comorbidities such as obesity and PsA. Delay in diagnosis could be another possible mechanism associated with worse outcomes in obesity, in addition to lower response to therapy.

Strengths of our study include the unique record linkage system of the REP, allowing near complete ascertainment of all clinically recognizable PsA cases in a well-defined population (14).  Furthermore, case ascertainment was done using the validated CASPAR criteria. Unlike administrative coding in most studies, all variables were collected via manual review of the paper and electronic records.

However, our study also has several limitations. While few PsA cases not fulfilling CASPAR criteria may have been missed, the sensitivity and specificity of the CASPAR criteria were close to 99% when adapted for retrospective use to identify PsA cohort (15). Due to the extended study period and availability of near-complete medical history in this population, we expect that most PsA cases would have been correctly ascertained. Second, being a retrospective study, the usual limitations regarding completeness of medical record documentation apply. Only those symptoms recorded in the medical records would be ascertained, and the precision/accuracy of exact symptom onset is uncertain. While our study did not examine patient reported or functional outcomes, a possible association of diagnostic delay with radiographic damage was seen. However, this association did not reach statistical significance, perhaps due to the limited sample size of the cohort and temporality could not be ascertained due to lack of radiographs before PsA diagnosis in most cases. Although the radiology reports were thoroughly reviewed, formal scoring by a radiologist was not performed. Lastly, the population of Olmsted County, Minnesota is predominantly white (90%), which may limit the generalizability of study results to other racial or ethnic groups.

In conclusion, more than half of PsA patients in our study had a diagnostic delay of >2 years, and no significant improvement in time to diagnosis was noted from 2000-17. Patients with younger age at PsA symptom onset, higher BMI, or enthesitis before diagnosis were more likely to have a diagnostic delay of >2 years. Better understanding of factors associated with diagnostic delay may help in earlier diagnosis and management to improve outcomes in high risk PsA patients. As not all patients have severe or progressive disease, identifying high risk patient subgroup will be important to stratify those that will benefit from early, aggressive treatment.

"text": "OBJECTIVE: To examine multimorbidity in psoriasis and its association with the development of PsA.

KEY FINDINGS:

1)        Our population-based cohort study showed a higher prevalence of multimorbidity in the prevalent but not incident cohort of psoriasis compared to the general population, suggesting that patients with psoriasis may experience accelerated development of multimorbidity.

2)        No difference in multimorbidity was noted based on the severity of psoriasis, underscoring the need for comprehensive management of morbidities in all patients with psoriasis, regardless of psoriasis severity.

3)        Most important and novel finding: Multimorbidity (≥2 morbidities) at psoriasis incidence (specifically nonspecific musculoskeletal and psychiatric disorders) was associated with a higher risk of PsA, highlighting the importance of monitoring multimorbid psoriasis patients for the potential development of PsA.

CORE MESSAGE: Study addresses the persistent diagnostic delay in PsA by examining demographic and clinical factors associated with delayed diagnosis

KEY IMPLICATIONS: The study highlights the importance of close monitoring for the development of PsA in this population, especially those with nonspecific musculoskeletal complaints and psychiatric disorders. Future studies should investigate the underlying mechanisms linking psoriasis, morbidities, and PsA to inform targeted prevention and treatment strategies.

"text": "Our population-based study, examining the prevalence and impact of multimorbidity in psoriasis and its association with PsA, highlights the complex relationship between multimorbidity and psoriasis and its potential role in the development of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The study showed a higher prevalence of multimorbidity (MM2 and MM5) in prevalent psoriasis, but not incident cases, relative to the general population. Approximately 3% of psoriasis patients developed PsA within 15 years of psoriasis onset. Multimorbidity (≥2 morbidities) at psoriasis incidence, specifically nonspecific musculoskeletal disorders and anxiety/depression, was associated with a higher risk of PsA.

Our findings suggest that patients with psoriasis may experience accelerated development of multimorbidity, as multimorbidity was more common in the prevalent but not incident cohort of psoriasis compared to the general population. The relationship between multimorbidity at psoriasis incidence and a higher risk of PsA is a novel finding. Notably, MM2 was associated with a higher PsA risk, but the same was not statistically evident for MM5 likely due to the low number of psoriasis patients developing PsA (the effect sizes were similar for MM5 and MM2). This is further supported by our sensitivity analysis (removing morbidities potentially related to undiagnosed PsA), which showed significantly higher risk of PsA with both MM2 and MM5. While previous studies have primarily focused on individual morbidities, some of these risk factors for PsA (e.g., obesity and alcohol abuse) are typically associated with other diseases, potentially contributing to multimorbidity (1,2).

Moreover, the association of nonspecific musculoskeletal disorders (peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and back disorders) and psychiatric disorders (anxiety and mood disorders), with PsA development in psoriasis highlights potential areas for targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Many studies have shown that non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia, fatigue, and stiffness in the prodromal phase of PsA are important factors associated with the development of PsA (3). They might signify early synovio-entheseal inflammation, emphasizing the importance of patient-reported outcomes in psoriasis patients (4). Interestingly, non-traumatic joint disorders were also more common at psoriasis incidence compared to comparators in our study. While they might signify prodromal symptoms of PsA, delay or underdiagnosis of PsA is another plausible explanation. We and others have shown that the majority of patients with PsA have a diagnostic delay of ≥2 years (5,6). Additionally, minor overuse conditions or injuries could act as triggers for PsA in the genetically susceptible. The higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and associated disorders in prevalent psoriasis compared to comparators is likely related to misclassification as rheumatoid arthritis before a confirmatory diagnosis of PsA has been made.

Similarly, the prevalence of mood disorders was significantly higher only in prevalent psoriasis and not the incident psoriasis compared to controls, suggesting that mood disorders probably develop later in the natural history of psoriasis. While multiple studies have described the association of depression with PsA, a cause-and-effect relationship has been difficult to ascertain (1). Inflammation has been suggested as an important link between depression and PsA, but the exact mechanism of this association is unclear (7,8). Our study provides additional evidence that mood disorders might play an important role in the transition of psoriasis to PsA.

Meanwhile, the association of obesity with the development of PsA did not reach significance in our incident psoriasis cohort. This finding, together with the higher prevalence of obesity in the incident but not prevalent psoriasis, might signify that obesity may be a more important risk factor for psoriasis than for PsA. However, our study is likely underpowered to examine the association of obesity with PsA.

Additionally, sociodemographic factors are important considerations for assessing the risk of PsA. In our study, the risk of developing PsA decreased with age, which is consistent with most studies(2). In fact, our previous study showed a peak incidence of PsA in 40 to 60 years of age with a subsequent decline in PsA incidence(9). Although there is a paucity of data on the risk of PsA by race, the prevalence of PsA, in general, seems to be higher in the white population compared to other racial categories(10). In our study, the risk of PsA was higher for non-white compared to the white population. However, our study included a relatively low number of non-white psoriasis patients. Therefore, further studies from a more diverse population should compare the risk of PsA in psoriasis patients among different racial and ethnic groups.

Our study leverages the REP's unique record linkage system and offers the first comprehensive assessment of all chronic conditions defined by HCUP in a population-based incident cohort of psoriasis. Yet, it has several limitations, including potential underestimation of mild PsA cases (who may not have presented with joint complaints), retrospective study design, limited power to examine the association of individual morbidities with PsA, and a predominantly white population which may limit generalizability.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated a higher prevalence of multimorbidity in prevalent psoriasis, but not incident psoriasis compared to the general population. No difference in multimorbidity was noted based on the severity of psoriasis, underscoring the need for comprehensive management of morbidities in patients with psoriasis, regardless of psoriasis severity. The risk of developing PsA was increased with multimorbidity at psoriasis incidence, highlighting the importance of close monitoring for the development of PsA in this population, especially those with nonspecific musculoskeletal complaints and psychiatric disorders. Future studies should investigate the underlying mechanisms linking psoriasis, morbidities, and PsA to inform targeted prevention and treatment strategies.
