# Academic manuscript introduction or background

### **Lexical Diversity**: 8/10

The text employs a rich variety of domain-specific vocabulary (e.g., "phenotype clusters," "oligoarticular disease," "biomarkers"). The use of technical terms is balanced with accessible phrasing for clarity.

**Example**: “The impact of PsA on patients’ lives is also heterogeneous, and the extent to which each disease characteristic affects physical function, work productivity, social participation, emotional well-being, and fatigue varies significantly.”

---

### **Syntactic Complexity**: 8/10

Sentences are complex, incorporating dependent clauses, parentheses, and modifiers. This reflects a scholarly tone while maintaining readability. Parallelism is used effectively in longer sentences to enumerate ideas. There is use of varying sentence lengths — small, medium, and long to give a natural flow and tone with emphasis on the main points.

**Example**: “Expanding this concept further to disease-specific features, different clinical subgroups within PsA may respond differently to expanding classes of medications available to treat psoriatic disease.”

---

### **Structural Organization**: 9/10

The text is well-structured, moving logically from problem identification to research aims. Each paragraph builds on the previous, with clear transitions. Enumerated objectives (A, B) enhance clarity.

**Example**: The final paragraph concludes by outlining study goals, summarizing the preceding arguments.

---

### **Tone and Register**: 9/10

The tone is formal, professional, and objective, suitable for an academic or medical audience. There is minimal emotional language, emphasizing data-driven conclusions.

**Example**: “Our previous work shows that disease characteristics such as comorbidities cluster in PsA, and certain clusters (e.g., anxiety/depression cluster) are associated with worse outcomes.”

---

### **Idiosyncratic Features**: 7/10

The author demonstrates a preference for precision and evidence-based reasoning, often referencing previous research. The style avoids rhetorical questions or speculative language, favoring definitive statements backed by citations.

**Example**: Frequent use of citations such as “[1]” and “[6]” reinforces the evidence-based nature of the discussion.

---

### **Perplexity and Burstiness**: 6/10

The writing maintains a steady level of complexity throughout. There are few variations in sentence length or structure that might create moments of "burstiness." This consistency aids comprehension but reduces stylistic dynamism.

**Example**: No significant stylistic departures, maintaining a uniform cadence.

---

### **Clarity of Purpose**: 10/10

The purpose is unambiguously stated: to investigate PsA phenotype clusters and their impact on treatment outcomes. The objectives are presented with precision and focus.

**Example**: “To develop more personalized and effective treatment strategies for PsA patients, our study aimed to: A) identify distinct PsA phenotype clusters and their trajectories, and B) examine the association of the clusters with treatment outcomes using a real-world cohort.”

---

### **Use of Figurative Language**: 2/10

The text avoids figurative language, prioritizing factual and clinical accuracy. This is appropriate for the intended audience.

**Example**: No use of metaphors or similes.

---

### **Focus on Evidence and Logic**: 10/10

The writing is deeply grounded in logic, presenting a clear chain of reasoning supported by references to previous work and real-world implications.

**Example**: “Yet, the current lack of biomarkers reliably predicting treatment response forces a trial-and-error approach in treatment, leading to unreliable responses, unnecessary side effects, and potential progression of the disease.”

---

### **Overall Writeprint Strengths**

1. **Evidence-based discourse** with a clear academic focus.
2. **Lexical and syntactic precision** supporting professional readability.
3. Logical progression from issue identification to research objectives.

---

## **5 Examples Exemplifying the Style**

1. **Introduction of Problem**:
    
    “Despite a significant increase in treatment options for psoriatic arthritis (PsA), only about 30% of patients achieve disease remission.”
    
2. **Deeper discussion of the Problem:**
    
    “However, every patient with PsA is unique, presenting with their own combination of symptoms (musculoskeletal and skin) with varying severity.”
    
3. **Outlining Research Gaps**:
    
    “Therefore, findings from the RCTs are not necessarily generalizable to real-world clinical practice, where majority of patients have oligoarticular disease.”
    
4. **Objective Presentation of Data**:
    
    “Our previous work shows that disease characteristics such as comorbidities cluster in PsA, and certain clusters (e.g., anxiety/depression cluster) are associated with worse outcomes.”
    
5. Objective of the study:
    
    “To develop more personalized and effective treatment strategies for PsA patients, our study aimed to: A) identify distinct PsA phenotype clusters and their trajectories, and B) examine the association of the clusters with treatment outcomes using a real-world cohort.”

"text": "Despite a significant increase in treatment options for psoriatic arthritis (PsA), only about 30% of patients achieve disease remission.[1] This is, in part, because PsA is studied and managed as if it were a single disease, similar to polyarticular rheumatoid arthritis.[2,3] However, every patient with PsA is unique, presenting with their own combination of symptoms (musculoskeletal and skin) with varying severity. [4] Additionally, the severity of skin psoriasis does not necessarily correlate with joint symptoms. The impact of PsA on patients’ lives is also heterogeneous, and the extent to which each disease characteristic affects physical function, work productivity, social participation, emotional well-being, and fatigue varies significantly.[5] However, current treatment recommendations primarily focus on the most severe aspects of the disease, not often capturing the heterogeneity of presentation and their diverse needs.[6]

The importance of early and effective treatment in PsA in terms of improving long-term prognosis, is well-recognized.[7] Yet, the current lack of biomarkers reliably predicting treatment response forces a trial-and-error approach in treatment, leading to unreliable responses, unnecessary side effects, and potential progression of the disease.[6] Our previous work shows that disease characteristics such as comorbidities cluster in PsA[8], and certain clusters (e.g., anxiety/depression cluster) are associated with worse outcomes.[9] Expanding this concept further to disease specific features, different clinical subgroups within PsA may respond differently to expanding classes of medications available to treat psoriatic disease.

Although phenotype clusters in PsA have been described using baseline data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs)[10–12],  RCTs generally enroll a homogenous subgroup of PsA (polyarticular). Therefore, findings from the RCTs are not necessarily generalizable to real-world clinical practice, where majority of patients have oligoarticular disease. Therefore, we lack an understanding of PsA phenotype clusters in the real-world setting and how they evolve over time. Additionally, it is unclear how these clusters relate to long-term outcomes in PsA. To develop more personalized and effective treatment strategies for PsA patients, our study aimed to: A) identify distinct PsA phenotype clusters and their trajectories, and B) examine the association of the clusters with treatment outcomes using a real-world cohort.

"text": "Up to 30% of patients with psoriasis eventually develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA) with psoriasis typically precedes PsA by five to seven years, providing a window to examine potential triggers (1). Studies suggest a higher prevalence of morbidities in PsA patients compared to those with psoriasis alone, implying a potential role in the transition (2). Yet, no single variable can predict this shift, highlighting the need to consider the broader, more patient-centric concept of multimorbidity, i.e., the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions irrespective of their onset  (3). This approach resonates with the high complexity often seen in psoriatic disease.

Given the urgent need to identify psoriasis patients at the highest risk of PsA to enable targeted preventive strategies, the objective of this study was to examine multimorbidity in psoriasis and its association with the development of PsA.

"text": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic musculoskeletal disease, which can lead to progressive joint pain, joint destruction, and loss of function. The impact on quality of life and functional status is similar to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (1). There is also increasing evidence that early diagnosis and treatment of PsA leads to improved long term outcomes for patients in terms of disease severity, and radiographic damage (2,3). Delays in diagnosis of even 6 to 12 months have been shown to be associated with joint damage and poor functional outcomes (3–5). Similarly, treatment response may also be better in early PsA (4). Despite this, the majority of patients have significant delays in diagnosis of PsA; up to 40% have not been previously identified in screening studies (6).

Several factors contribute to delay in diagnosis of PsA. While early diagnosis is important in PsA, awareness of PsA compared to RA is poor in community practice (7). The clinical presentation of PsA is heterogeneous, and there are no definitive, gold standard diagnostic tests. Similarly, psoriasis patients may not report joint symptoms or be aware of joint inflammation. Moreover, psoriasis patients can have joint pain due to other common etiologies such as osteoarthritis, gout, and fibromyalgia (6,8). Another issue is that approximately 10–15% of patients develop arthritis prior to psoriasis, posing additional difficulty with diagnosis (9).

Only a few studies have examined delay in diagnosis of PsA, most of which relied on patient surveys or administrative data for ascertainment of the date of PsA diagnosis, which may be misleading. A study from Europe showed improvement in time to diagnosis for PsA (10). However, the trends in diagnostic delay of PsA in the US and factors associated with delay in diagnosis have not been well studied. Lack of longitudinal, population-based PsA cohorts in the US has made this type of study difficult.

To improve early diagnosis and long-term outcomes, a better understanding of the current diagnostic landscape and the factors contributing to delays is essential. The aims of our study were to 1) examine the diagnostic delay in PsA in residents of Olmsted County from 2000-17, and 2) identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with diagnostic delay in PsA.
